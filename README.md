# The Acoustics Arena

This is a website for a fake lab, as a part of Git training by Paul Anzel. Slides for this talk can be found [right here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1njdRK0la0cCh3AiPoYeOiqgw36jRGnt70Gz80emG9Sc/edit?usp=sharing).

Welcome, [to the laboratoire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdHFmc9oiKY)!

## Basics

This is a website for the Anzel acoustics lab. This repository contains common code for the entire lab to use and share. Folders are as follows:

- `instruments`: Documentation and calibration for important instruments around the lab.
- `analysis_code`: Various code routines for different types of analysis.
- `weekly_meeting`: Please upload slides from weekly meeting presentations to here.
- `teaching_materials`: Class materials for Git training.

## Updating code

In order to ensure that we don't accidentally mess up our colleagues code, I ask that for any changes that you make that you please create a branch for your work, and then open a pull request to merge your changes in. If you notice any problems with the code, you can also open an issue and we can figure out who would be the best person to solve it.
